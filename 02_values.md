## Simplify And Go

note:

It can be easy to over prepare and overthink it. Get a basic outline ready, and go. (Talk about the progression from running your first game to that inevitable session where you're like, "You know what? I didn't prepare at all for this game tonight, and it was just fine!")


## Embrace Change

note:

you _will not_ predict what your players will do. Be ready to be surprised and roll with it.


## Choose To Be Happy

note:

See above. Also know that the point of playing is to have fun. It can be easy to loose sight of that sometimes when you're stressing out about scheduling, etc.


## Own It

note:

Know your shit. Don't show up to the table not knowing how to play your character. Own your bad calls.


## Give More Than You Take

note:

sure, yeah, do this too.
