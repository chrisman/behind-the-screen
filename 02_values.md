## Simplify And Go

note:

It can be easy to over prepare and overthink it. Get a basic outline ready, and go. (Talk about the progression from running your first game to that inevitable session where you're like, "You know what? I didn't prepare at all for this game tonight, and it was just fine!")

How to think creatively and outside the box. How to apply the tools you have in unique ways to unusual situation.


## Embrace Change

note:

you _will not_ predict what your players will do. Be ready to be surprised and roll with it.

think on your toes


## Choose To Be Happy

note:

See above. Also know that the point of playing is to have fun. It can be easy to loose sight of that sometimes when you're stressing out about scheduling, etc.


## Own It

note:

Know your shit. Don't show up to the table not knowing how to play your character. Own your bad calls.


## Give More Than You Take

note:

this is literally what running a game is. You're the one who needs to prep beforehand. You create a scenario for your players and step aside, abjudicate when necessary.

Learning that which is narratively satisfying has broad implications. Suddenly many things become a story that you can present in a way that showcases your skills, be it a client demo or presenting findings in a meeting or presenting at a company event.
